    <div class="header"><h1>Hypothetical Space Habitats</h1>
        <p>For this assignment I've decided to introduce some hypothetical space habitats.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="paragraphs">
    <h2>O'neill Cylinder</h2>
        <p>O'Neill Cylinders are massive, rotating space habitats shaped like cylindrical tubes.They rotate to create centrifugal force, simulating gravity on the interior surface. The interior surface provides living space, agriculture, industry, and recreational areas for large populations. O'Neill Cylinders are envisioned for long-term space colonization, offering self-sustaining environments for humans.</p>

    <h2>Ringworld</h2>
        <p>Ringworlds are colossal structures shaped like giant rings or hoops encircling a star. They spin to create centrifugal force, allowing inhabitants to live on the inner surface with artificial gravity. Ringworlds have immense surface area, potentially supporting populations in the trillions and diverse ecosystems.Ringworlds are often portrayed in science fiction as megastructures for advanced civilizations, housing vast populations and advanced technologies.</p>

    <h2>Stanford Torus</h2>
        <p>Bernal Spheres, also known as Stanford Tori, are habitat designs shaped like ring-like structures with a central hub.They rotate to generate centrifugal force for gravity. They rotate to generate centrifugal force for gravity. These habitats are conceived for future space colonization, balancing artificial gravity and sustainable environments. </p>

    <h2>Further Reading</h2>
    <p>If you are interested in learning more, I recommend the following website, <a href="https://projectrho.com/public_html/rocket/">Atomic Rockets</a>, along with the wikipedia pages for the respective habitats. </p>

    </ol>

    <strong><p class="epilogue">As stated, these designs and concepts are nothing more than ideation at this point, but when humanity does reach the point of undertaking such building projects, we can confidently say that our road of expansion to space will truly have opened.</p></strong>
