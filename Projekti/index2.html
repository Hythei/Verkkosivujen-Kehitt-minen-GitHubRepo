                <p>
                    As humanity reaches its grasp into the stars and if indeed our progress is not stunted by ecological disaster, we may very well advance to become a Kardashev type 1 civilisation, harnessing the full energy potential of our planet and beginning the resource extraction of our nearest stellar objects. Becoming such a civilisations presents our descendants with great possibilities in the realm of architecture and engineering the cruel chains of gravity are thrown off. Such a future presents us with various possibilities in all scientific fields.

                    Megastructures refer to large-scale artificial engineering projects, typically of gargantuan size that are constructured for various purposes, such as space habitation or energy generation. They are characterised for pushing the limits of engineering, construction capabilities, and our present understanding of the universe. As one might extrapolate from the present state of affairs on our planet, humanity has yet to construct any megastructures and as such they are contained in the realm of speculation and science fiction, where they are envisioned as constructs built in space, around stars, and/or within planetary systems.
