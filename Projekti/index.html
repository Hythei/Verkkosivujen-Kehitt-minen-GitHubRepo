                <p>
                    As humanity reaches its grasp into the stars and if indeed our progress is not stunted by ecological disaster, we may very well advance to become a Kardashev type 1 civilisation, harnessing the full energy potential of our planet and beginning the resource extraction of our nearest stellar objects. Becoming such a civilisations presents our descendants with great possibilities in the realm of architecture and engineering once the cruel chains of gravity are thrown off. Let us consider some of them.

                    Megastructures refer to large-scale artificial engineering projects, typically of gargantuan size that are constructured for various purposes, such as space habitation or energy generation. They are characterised for pushing the limits of engineering, construction capabilities, and our present understanding of the universe. As one might extrapolate from the present state of affairs on our planet, humanity has yet to construct any megastructures and as such they are contained in the realm of speculation and science fiction, where they are envisioned as constructs built in space, around stars, and/or within planetary systems.

                    Ion Engines Powering Deep Space Exploration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Ion engines as a novel concept were first introduced in 1911 by Konstantin Tsiolkovsky, a working prototype thruster was developed and tested in 1959 by NASA, with further research being undertaken and conducted in the decades since, we can safely say that the technology is not a new invention, but in recent years there have been breakthroughs which make the practical future usage of the drive considerable. Unlike traditional chemical rockets that rely on combustion, ion engines utilize the electromagnetic force to accelerate charged particles, or ions, to high speeds. This efficient propulsion method enables spacecraft to travel for extended periods without refueling, making them particularly well-suited for deep space missions.

                <p>
                    The cost of launching spacecraft has traditionally been a major hurdle for space exploration, limiting the scope and frequency of missions. However, recent advancements in reusable rocket technology have revolutionized space access, making it more affordable and sustainable. Advances in manufacturing techniques and processes have resulted in the production of lighter, more durable, and cost-effective components which in turn have made the construction of reusable launch vehicles possible, eliminating the need of building new rockets for each mission.
